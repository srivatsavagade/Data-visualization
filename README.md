# **Data Visualization Project**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on visualizing data to uncover insights and trends using Python libraries like **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**. 
It demonstrates how visualizations can help interpret data effectively and aid in decision-making.

---

## **Features**
- Interactive and static visualizations.
- Use of multiple chart types:
  - Line plots, scatter plots, bar plots.
  - Histograms, box plots, and heatmaps.
  - Advanced pair plots and correlation matrices.
- Customization of visuals for clarity and impact:
  - Titles, subtitles, labels, and annotations.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Visualization Libraries**:
  - **Matplotlib**: Basic visualizations.
  - **Seaborn**: Statistical plots and enhanced visuals.
  - **Plotly**: Interactive charts.
- **Data Manipulation**:
  - **Pandas**: Cleaning and preparation of datasets.

## **Project Goals**
1. Create meaningful and customizable visualizations.
2. Understand the relationship between variables.
3. Demonstrate trends, distributions, and correlations within datasets.

---

## **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/srivatsavagade/data-visualization-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd data-visualization-project
   ```


---

## **Usage**
1. Open Jupyter Notebook or your IDE.
2. Load the dataset virat.csv.
3. Run the provided scripts to generate visualizations:
   - Analyze trends using line plots.
   - Study relationships using scatter plots and pair plots.
   - Understand distributions with histograms and box plots.

## **Examples of Visualizations**
1. **Line Chart**:  
   Visualize trends of runs over matches.  
2. **Bar Chart**:  
   Compare categories runs scored with respective different teams.  
3. **Heatmap**:  
   Identify correlations and patterns between numerical variables.  
4. **Pair Plot**:  
   Explore pairwise relationships between multiple variables.
